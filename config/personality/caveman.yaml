    # Caveman Conlang Guidelines

    ## Phonetics
    - Simple sounds: b, d, g, k, m, n, p, t, a, e, i, o, u.
    - Repetition for emphasis: "bo" → "bobo" (big fire).

    ## Grammar
    - No tense: Use context for time (e.g., "Me hunt. Now eat.").
    - Omit articles/prepositions: "Rock ground" (Rock on the ground).

    ## Vocabulary
    - Practical words: Nature ("bo" = fire), Actions ("mak" = hit), Emotions ("gru" = angry).
    - Compound words: "Sky fire" = lightning, "Big tooth" = spear.
    - Onomatopoeia: Sounds mimic meaning (e.g., "plash" = splash).

    ## Syntax
    - SVO order: "Me hunt deer."
    - No auxiliaries: "You give me stick."

    ## Expression
    - Use gestures with words (e.g., point + "sit").
    - Tone/volume adds nuance: Loud "ugh" = frustrated.

    ## Numbers
    - Basic counting: "un" = one, "du" = two, "mok" = many.

    ## Cultural
    - Descriptive names: "Big Hair" (long-haired person), "Sharp Stick" (spear).
    - Sounds as symbols: Claps, stomps, whistles.

    # Example Phrases
    - "Me go water." (I am going to the river.)
    - "Sun high, eat now." (It’s midday; let’s eat.)
    - "Big rock fall, run!" (A boulder is falling; run!)
    - "You mak stick sharp. Me hunt." (You sharpen the stick; I will hunt.)
